# 6to5 Base Project

Use this project as a base for your ECMAScript6 webmodule projects
that use 6to5.

## Setup instructions

1. Clone/copy the contents of this repo to a new folder.
2. Fill in your webmodule information in `package.json`, replacing
   `YOUR-WEBMODULE-NAME` with the webmodule name and so on. Make
   sure you remove the `"private": true` line to allow `npm publish`
   to work.
3. Add your code to `index.es6` and to other `.es6` files, as needed.
   `.js` files are generated by 6to5.
4. Use `make build` to build the `.js` files. They're also generated
   automatically before publishing. (Check the `prepublish` script in 
   `package.json`)
5. Replace this readme with the readme of your webmodule project.
6. Push to github, then `npm publish`.

## Todo

- Add test code / make rules.
